# i3 for Windows (but not really)

-   I'll try to implement some of the i3 features in Windows using C

## How to build & run

1. Using VS

2. Using build.bat on the command line

    - You need to load MSVC in your environment. You can find the official instructions here https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170
    - I load it in the command prompt or cmder by calling "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
        - The location on your machine may differ depending on the Visual Studio version you use

## Official docs
