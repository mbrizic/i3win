# TODO

## Functional
- in split layout, remove extra space between windows
- add option to change main window sizes (in centered layout, maybe in split one as well)
- command to move window to start/end
- can't move windows with admin right unless this program is also ran with admin rights

## UI Stuff
- add tray icon (show active workspace number)
- hide terminal window when program is running

## Configuration
- check if config file exists

## Performance
- avoid redrawing layout if no new windows appear
